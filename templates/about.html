        The growing conflict over the treasure between Dwarves, Elves, and Men, likely to result in bloodshed, was suddenly
        averted by the approach of goblin and warg armies, so they instead joined forces to defeat their common enemies in
        what was later called the Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Thorin led an assault that proved his strength
        as a leader, striking out from the mountain and providing vital aid as the goblins threatened to overwhelm his
        allies. He fought courageously, but was mortally wounded in the battle, requiring Beorn to take him to safety.
